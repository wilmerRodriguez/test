## Welcome to My Github site! 
Hi there and thanks for checking out my github link :). I'll explain real fast how I used Git Pages in order to build, test, debug, and collaborate with friends and the web development community to horn on my creative skills. By learning everything at home using [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/share/1025BOBkcaeVhW/) and [Tuto.com](https://fr.tuto.com/formation-developpeur-front-end.htm) I continue to learn all the new technologies.
